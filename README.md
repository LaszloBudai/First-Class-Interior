# First-Class-Interior
The Auckland-based business "First Class Interior" awarded my company Accenture a contract to produce them a well designed website. This business is well known for providing top-notch interior design services for a variety of buildings, including homes, restaurants, businesses, schools, casinos, and more. The First Class interiors firm is searching for a more interactive and user-friendly website. The corporation wants to expand across the nation to increase the benefits from their business.
